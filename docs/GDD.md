Players can call Finish Turn, also if an opponent is taking more time than he had allocated, if a player gets his turn finished by another player due to being overtime, he gets a penalty there are multiple implementations of what a penalty can be.

A round is considered done when all players have done their turn, turn and round are intended to trigger game events, in the game.

#### Player Actions

Once the player has created or joined a game he has three possible actions he can perform during the game.

- **Choose And Place**: Choose and place is the action where a player chooses a tile from the selection, and places it on his grid in an appropriate space, there are certain conditions, and requirements to choose and place.
  - Choose Requirements, each tile has a cost assigned. Depending on the Tile type and the Tile Rarity, prices can vary, the minimum price for a tile is 1 Mana.
  - Place Requirements, tiles can not be placed without having a connection to another tile, and you can only place the tile in a space.

- **Upgrade**: Tiles can be upgraded in rarity, by fulfilling certain resource requirements, as example, the home tile can be upgraded to allocate more places for humans. 
  - Upgrade Requirements, each tile has an upgrade cost map, if it is able to be upgraded
