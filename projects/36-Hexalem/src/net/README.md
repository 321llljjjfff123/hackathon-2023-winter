# Net

The `net` folder contains:
- Shared logic (`Engine`), that is then used by **Unity UI** and others.
- Automated tests.
- `WebAPI`, that was initially used for quick scaffolding.
- `NetApiExt`, which is an automatically generated c# project by Substrate.Net.Toolchain, for communication with the Substrate Node.
- `Integration`, that combines `Engine` and `NetApiExt`.
