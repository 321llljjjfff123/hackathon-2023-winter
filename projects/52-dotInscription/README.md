# Dot Inscription

## Background of the project

Recently, memes from BRC 20 to ORC 20 and "Wizards" to "Frog Pepe" have sparked FOMO in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Alongside the Ordinals protocol, Bitcoin Script protocol RGB and various Layer 2 projects have become hot trends. New projects aim to join and build the Bitcoin ecosystem, capitalizing on renewed opportunities.

Despite script market potential with fair launch and decentralized features, a critical issue remainsâ€”the script's indexer. This application, retrieving transaction data, is crucial; without it, there is no script. However, current indexers on project servers contradict decentralization, allowing teams to alter rules and invalidate user scripts.

## Description

This project aims to address this issue, unlocking the full potential of the script market. DotInscription is a Polkadot parachain designed to serve as a decentralized indexer deployment platform for scripts. The project teams behind scripts need to bring their indexers on-chain in the form of smart contracts on DotInscription. These indexers will only retrieve data from nodes on other chains, achieving a truly decentralized indexer.
